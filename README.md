- Check that the backend server is running
- Ensure CORS is properly configured on the backend

**Card Not Found Errors:**
- Check card name spelling
- Ensure cards are from supported MTG sets
- Try using exact card names without quantities

**Slow Loading:**
- The Scryfall API has rate limits
- Large decklists may take longer to process
- Consider reducing decklist size for testing
